== Dealing with version conflict

&#x2694;

=== What is a version conflict?
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

* Multiple paths to dependency
** Disagree on version
* Optimistic upgrade strategy
** Highest version that satisfies all

=== Some examples
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

* [red]#`1.0.0`# and [red]#`1.0.5`# => [red]#`1.0.5`#
* [red]#`1.0.0`# and [red]#`2.0.0`# => [red]#`2.0.0`#
* [red]#`[1.0, 2.0[`# and [red]#`1.5`# => [red]#`1.5`#
* [red]#`1.5`# and [red]#`[2.0, 3.0[`# => latest [red]#`2.x`# available
* [red]#`[1.0, 2.0[`# and [red]#`[3.0, 4.0[`# => latest [red]#`3.x`# available

=== Understanding why a version was selected

* Dependency insight report
** Variant selection information
** Selection reasons
** All paths to a dependency

=== And what about downgrading?

* Use `strictly`
** Overrules versions lower in graph
* Is published
** Visible for consumers

=== Cross module version conflict

What is the common point between the following libraries?

* `com.fasterxml.jackson*`
* `org.springframework:spring-*`
* `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-*`
* and many others

=== Dependencies group
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

* Set of dependencies sharing a version
* Designed to work when using a single version.

In short, you want alignment of versions across dependencies.

=== Aligning dependencies
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

* Group of dependencies to align
* Platform listing them
* Upgrade of one triggers upgrade of all

=== Alignment with published platform
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

* Dependencies of the group depend on the platform
